*Jog* is a JavaScript logging package. It allows you to insert tracking and debug
statements in your code which you can turn on and off as needed. Messages can
be sent to multiple handlers to be put into the web page, a popup web page,
and/or the console.

It is analogous to java.util.logging or log4j, but designed for a simpler JQuery
environment. It relies on JQuery to do its own HTML work.
