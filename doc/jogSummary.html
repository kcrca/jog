<p>Jog is a JavaScript/JQuery logging package for application logging, analogous
   to Java packages such as log4j or java.util.logging. It allows you to
   separate your logs into various areas so you can turn on the logs of one area
   without seeing all the others, especially those of plugins or other packages
   you may be using. Using jog usually is as simple as this:</p>

<pre>$.jog('options').info('Reading user option settings');</pre>

<p>This creates an informational-level log message for the "options" area of
   your code to indicate you were, well, reading the user option settings.</p>

<p><a href="doc/demo.html">Care to see it in action?</a></p>

<p>There are several existing log packages for JQuery, so why does this one need
   to exist? None of the others had the ability to do two important things for
   real-world, durable, usable logging: areas and handlers.</p>

<p>Logging areas let you split logging for one part of your code from other
   parts and control them independently. This is critical for plugins and other
   shared code. Without areas, if someone uses logging for their own stuff, they
   also see your log messages. This gets much worse if they are using multiple
   plugins. So you need to strip log statements as part of releasing your code,
   which defeats the purpose. Jog has areas, so you can leave log messages in
   place and they won't bother anyone else &mdash; unless you ask them to turn
   it on to help debug a problem they've found.</p>

<p>Handlers are important because plugins and programmers differ. Console log
   messages can be ugly and difficult to save, but are simple and don't
   interfere with your own page. HTML logs do interfere, but CSS can make it
   easier to see what's up, and you can search and save. Logs in a popup don't
   interfere and can handle logs from multiple windows in one place, yet having
   another window can be a hassle. And alerts, well, you know how unpleasant
   they are &mdash; and how necessary at times.</p>

<p>As you can see, depending on how you like to work and many other factors,
   being able to control how message are displayed is a powerful thing. And
   beyond that, you can add a handle to send messages to your server, or one
   that uses Growl, or ...</p>

<p>So that is why I found it worth the time to write this. I hope it helps you
   out.</p>
