<h2>JOG: Javascript Logging Package</h2>

<h3>Quick Start</h3>

<p>Jog is a logging package for Javascript and JQuery, designed to be used for
client-side application logging, analogous to Java packages such as log4j or
java.util.logging. It allows you to separate your logs into various areas so
you can turn on the logs of one area without seeing all the others, especially
those of plugins or other packages you may be using. Using jog usually is as
simple as this:</p>
<pre>$.jog('options').info('Reading user option settings');</pre>

<p>This creates an informational-level log message for the "options" area of
your code to indicate you were, well, reading the user option settings.</p>

<p>"Info" is just one of several levels, ranging from "Fine" (for very
fine-grained debug logging) to "Alert" for messages that should be signaled
even to non-developers. You can configure what level of messages you are
interested in generally, and for specific areas of your code. If you were
currently debugging the options area of your code you could:</p>
<pre>$.jog('options').level($.jog.Debug);</pre>

<p>By default this puts informational-level log messages on the console, but
you can configure messages to go onto the page, or in a popup window, or any
place you like:</p>
<pre>$.jog('options').addHandler($.jog.knownHandlers.popup);</pre>

<p>This adds a handler for options messages that puts log messages in a popup
window, as well as on the console.</p>

<h3>The Basics: Areas and Levels</h3>

<p>When working on software, you often want to track values as they change, or
which code is executing. Often this is done by adding "print" statements. These
debug messages can be worth holding on to for the next time you have problems
in that code. Logging is a common way to do this: Instead of simple print
statements, you put in conditional print statements that can be turned on and
off as needed. In Java, the <code>java.util.logging</code> package and the
log4j package provide these tools. Other languages have similar tools. The jog
package is designed to do this for Javascript/JQuery using terms and approaches
that are already familiar to developers.</p>

<p>Each log message applies to some area of code, so the basic organizing block
of jog is the <i>area.</i> When you write a log statement, you start by
specifying the area to jog:</p>
<pre>$.jog(<i>areaName</i>)</pre>

<p>The jog function returns an area object that governs the area's logging. The
primary operation on that object is to write log messages:</p>
<pre>$.jog(<i>areaName</i>).log(<i>level</i>, <i>message</i>)</pre>

<p>Each area has a <i>level</i> at which it is allowing messages to be
displayed. Messages at that level or above are displayed; messages below it are
silently ignored. The levels are <code>Fine</code>, <code>Debug</code>,
<code>Info</code>, <code>Config</code>, <code>Warning</code>,
<code>Severe</code>, <code>Alert</code>, and <code>Off</code>. The default
logging threshold level for all areas is <code>Info</code>. Level constants are
obtained directly from jog (such as <code>$.jog.Debug</code>).</p>

<p>You can also specify the message level by invoking the appropriately-named
method on the area object, such as:</p>
<pre>$.jog('options').info('Reading user option settings');</pre>

<p>Generally this form is easier to read and takes less space, but you might
sometimes need the level-specifying <code>log()</code> function when you are
writing code where the level must come from a variable.</p>

<p>Wherever a level is passed to jog, the preferred value to pass is the number
from <code>$.jog</code>, such as <code>$.jog.Debug</code>. But you can also
pass the number as a string, or the name of the level, or any string that
starts with the first character of the level (case is always ignored). These
string versions can be useful to you at times, but the numbers are faster, and
keeping the overhead of logging down is important.</p>

<p>Areas can have sub-areas. This is a good way to isolate your log messages
from other people's code, and to break up your own log messages into logical
groupings. You might, for example, be writing an application that has a UI,
various local computations, and communication with a remote server. If this is
a simple application you might only need three areas: "'ui", "compute", and
"server".</p>

<p>But if the UI, for example, had a separate user preferences area, you might
want to have "ui.main" and "ui.prefs". This, in fact, defines three areas:
"ui.main", "ui.prefs", and their common parent area "ui". You can turn on debug
messages for both by setting them on the parent:</p>
<pre>$.jog('ui').level($.jog.Debug);</pre>

<p>If a threshold level isn't set on an area, it will use it's parent's value.
And at the top there is a root area, which is the ultimate parent of all areas
and has the overall defaults. For example, the root area is where the default
level of <code>Info</code> is set. So this would set the overall log level to
<code>Debug</code> instead:</p>
<pre>$.jog().level($.jog.Debug);</pre>

<p>The settings used for an area will be the most specific to that area. In
other words, when looking for a threshold level for <code>ui.prefs</code>, the
area ui.prefs is checked for a level setting. If there isn't one, then the
<code>ui</code> area is checked. Finally, the root level is checked if no
intervening area has a setting.</p>

<p>If you want to print out more than a basic log message, you may want to
first check to see if the resulting message would be visible. For example, you
can avoid expensive logging calculations if the log message will just get
filtered out:</p>
<pre>if ($.jog('ui').debug()) {
    // <i>... calculate median value ...</i>
    $.jog('ui').debug('The median value is ' + median);
}</pre>

<p>Another possibility is to pass in a function that returns a message instead
of the message itself. The function will only be called if the message is to be
logged, so its overhead is avoided when the log message is filtered out:</p>
<pre>$.jog('ui').debug(function() {
    // <i>... calculate median value ...</i>
    return 'The median value is ' + median;
});</pre>

<p>You can hold on to area objects so you don't have to keep looking them up.
This further reduces the overhead of using log messages because the lookup is
done only once. For example, you can have this near the top of your code:</p>
<pre>var uiLogger = $.jog('ui');</pre>

<p>Then you can use uiLogger instead of looking up the logger:</p>
<pre>if (uiLogger.debug()) {
    // <i>... calculate median value ...</i>
    uiLogger.debug('The median value is ' + median);
}</pre>

<p>If you want an area to stop enforcing a threshold, you can set the level to
<code>undefined</code>. Then it will once again delegate the threshold choice
to an area above it.</p>
<pre>$.jog('ui.prefs').level(undefined);</pre>

<p>The level named <code>Off</code> is the highest level, intended to be used
only as a threshold level. Therefore it is not a valid level for a log message.
A log at the <code>Off</code> level is never shown.</p>

<p>The object $.jog.levels has the levels -- and only the levels -- as its
properties. The level names are usually accessed through <code>$.jog</code>
itself (<code>$.jog.Fine</code>) instead of this object
(<code>$.jog.levels.Fine</code>) It is a way you can loop through the
levels:</p>
<pre>for (var logLevel in $.jog.levels) { ... }</pre>

<p>It is perfectly possible to log messages in the root area, but you should
only do this if you are writing code you don't expect anyone else to use. If
you did that in a function you published for others, and they wanted to use jog
too, your messages would be displayed along with any of theirs, and that would
be unwelcome. If you expect others to use your code, put logging into an area
whose name you expect to be unique to your code.</p>

<h3>Basic Output: Handlers</h3>

<p>Once a log message has passed the level threshold test, where does it go?
The answer is that you can configure that.</p>

<p><i>Handlers</i> are objects that take messages and presents them. By default
jog includes a handler that shows messages on the console via
<code>console.log()</code>:</p>
<pre>ui - Info - 19:12:12 - The median value is 4.3</pre>

<p>These are the components of the displayed log message: the area, level, the
current time, and message.</p>

<p>The other default handler is the alert handler, which pops up an alert
window visible to the user. This would be very annoying for most messages,
which is a good example of why a handler can also have its own threshold level
of use. The alert handler's threshold is Alert; any messages below this level
are ignored by the handler.</p>

<p>The known handler objects that are provided by jog are:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>console</dt>
    <dd>Writes messages to <code>console.log()</code>.</dd>
  <dt>alert</dt>
    <dd>Pops up an alert message via <code>alert()</code>.</dd>
  <dt>html</dt>
    <dd>Writes messages to table on the current page.</dd>
  <dt>popup</dt>
    <dd>Pops up a new window and writes messages to table on that page.</dd>
</dl>

<p>When a log message should be displayed, the area defines which handlers will
be used. In most cases the handlers for an area is the union of all the
handlers in itself and its parents, including the root. (It is possible to mark
an area as not inheriting handlers from its parents, though that is uncommon.)
The handlers are asked (in any order) to do their job.</p>

<p>Again, the root area is the place where the defaults are. In this case, the
set of handlers at the root is what is used by most areas, and its default is
the console and alert handlers.</p>

<p>You can access the known handlers this way:</p>
<pre>$.jog.knownHandlers</pre>

<p>For example, if you want to change the root area's handlers to be only the
html handler, you could do this:</p>
<pre>$.jog().handlers($.jog.knownHandlers.html);</pre>

<p>Or if you simply wanted to add it to the root area's handlers:</p>
<pre>$.jog().addhandlers($.jog.knownHandlers.html);</pre>

<p>You can configure these handler objects via their <code>config()</code>
methods, which take property objects. For example, the <code>html</code>
handler can be told the ID of the HTML element inside which the log should be
placed:</p>
<pre>$.jog.knownHandlers.html.config({htmlId: 'putTheLogHere'});</pre>

<p>The handler's threshold level is configured this way as well. If you want
alerts for all messages at or above Warning, you could say:</p>
<pre>$.jog.knownHandlers.alert.config({level: $.jog.Warning});</pre>

<p>The level can be set on any handler. Here are the handlers provided by jog,
and their non-standard configurable values:</p>
<dl>
  <dt><code>console</code></dt>
    <dd>Each log message is printed on the console using
      <code>console.log()</code>. </dd>
    <dd><dl>
        <dt><code>prefix</code></dt>
          <dd>A prefix that will be added to every log message on the console.
            This could help you find jog's log messages amidst other consol log
            message. The default is <code>""</code>. </dd>
        <dt><code>separator</code></dt>
          <dd>The separator between elements in log messages. The default is
            <code>" - "</code>. </dd>
      </dl>
    </dd>
  <dt><code>alert</code></dt>
    <dd>Each log message is show to the user with <code>alert()</code>. (This
      handler has no custom configurations.)</dd>
  <dt><code>html</code></dt>
    <dd>Each message is appended to a table on the current page. By default,
      when the first log message passes the level filter and is to be
      displayed, it will look for an HTML node with a give ID, and append the
      table inside it. </dd>
    <dd><dl>
        <dt><code>idPrefix</code></dt>
          <dd>A prefix applied to the identifiers of HTML elements in the
            generated table of log messages. The default is <code>"jog"</code>,
            so the ID of the table itself is <code>jog-table</code> and the
            header row's id is <code>jog-header</code>. </dd>
        <dt><code>classPrefix</code></dt>
          <dd>A prefix applied to the class names of HTML elements in the
            generated table of log messages. The default is <code>"jog"</code>,
            so the ID of the table itself is <code>jog-table</code>, and the
            header row's id is <code>jog-header</code> (yes, the same as the
            ID's). The cells of the columns also have classes:
            <code>jog-area</code> for the area names; <code>jog-level</code>
            for the levels; <code>jog-when</code> for the times; and
            <code>jog-message</code> for the actual messages. In addition, each
            row has two classes:
            <code>jog-level-</code><i>levelName<code></code></i> and
            <code>jog-area-</code><i>areaName</i> for the level and area of the
            individual log. For example, in an Info message in the ui area,
            they would be <code>log-level-Info</code> and
            <code>log-area-ui</code>. Note: When used as part of a class name,
            the area name has all its dot separators replaced with dashes
            because CSS doesn't handle dots in class names easily; therefore
            table rows for <code>ui.prefs</code> would by default have the
            class name <code>jog-area-ui-prefs</code>.</dd>
        <dt><code>htmlId</code></dt>
          <dd>The ID of the node which will contain the log table, which will
            be created if it doesn't exist. When the first message is to be
            displayed, the handler will first look for a node with that ID. If
            it finds one, the table will be appended to that node. If it does
            not, it will create a blank <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> with this ID.
            This will be appended to the end of the page (but see
            <code>insertHtml</code> below). The default value is generated
            using <code>idPrefix</code>, so the default if
            <code>idPrefix</code> is untouched is <code>jog-html</code>. </dd>
        <dt><code>insertHtml</code></dt>
          <dd>The first time a log message needs to be displayed, if a node
            with the correct ID (<code>htmlId</code>) cannot be found on the
            page, this function will be called to insert it, in the context of
            the handler (so this will be a reference to the handler). The
            default is to append a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> to the body of the
            page. The function must return the node to use; the handler will
            set the ID and class as required. </dd>
      </dl>
    </dd>
    <dd>It may help to have this described from the top down. The following is
      what the logging area would look like if the html handler was configured
      with the idPrefix of <code>"jogID"</code> and the classPrefix of
      <code>"jogClass"</code>, with one log row from the
      <code>"ui.prefs"</code> area:</dd>
    <dd><pre style="margin-left:2em;">&lt;div id="jogID-html"&gt;
  &lt;table class="jogClass-table" id="jogID-table"&gt;
    &lt;tbody&gt;
      &lt;tr class="jogClass-header" id="jogID-header"&gt;
        &lt;th id="JogID-area"&gt;Area&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th id="JogID-level"&gt;Level&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th id="JogID-when"&gt;When&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th id="JogID-message"&gt;Message&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr class="jogClass-level-Info jogClass-area-ui jogClass-area-ui-prefs"&gt;
        &lt;td class="jogClass-area"&gt;ui.prefs&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class="jogClass-level"&gt;Info&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class="jogClass-when"&gt;17:36:09&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class="jogClass-message"&gt;Read Me!&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/tbody&gt;
  &lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
    </dd>
  <dt><code>popup</code></dt>
    <dd>A new browser window will be popped up, and inside that window,
      messages will be shown in a table in that window using an html handler
      (with a default configuration). </dd>
    <dd><dl>
        <dt><code>title</code></dt>
          <dd>The title of the window. The default is <code>"Log
            Messages"</code>. </dd>
        <dt><code>css</code></dt>
          <dd>The CSS to use for the page in the window. It can a path name of
            a css file, in which case it will be used in a
            <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> block in the window's header. Or it can
            be a chunk of HTML itself, in which case it will replace that
            <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> node in the header. The default is
            <code>"jog.css"</code>, which is provided as a file with this
            package. </dd>
      </dl>
    </dd>
</dl>

<h3>Advanced Topic: Time Formatting</h3>

<p>An area can also define the format of the time value. By default this is
formatted using the <code>Date</code> object's
<code>toLocaleTimeString()</code> method. You can override this by setting the
<code>timeFormat</code> function in the area's object. Like the threshold
level, this will be inherited by sub-areas that don't themselves override it.
And again, like the threshold level, the default behavior is defined at the
root area, and can be overridden there:</p>
<pre>$.jog().timeFormat = function(when) { ... }</pre>

<p>The when parameter is a <code>Date</code> object whose time is to be
formatted.</p>

<h3>Advanced Topic: Derived Level Information</h3>

<p>When you ask for values on a level, you get the values set for that level
specifically. For example, if you haven't set anything specific on the
<code>'ui'</code> level, then <code>$.jog('ui').level()</code> will return an
<code>undefined</code>. This means it will look to its parent to find out the
threshold level. If you want to know the threshold that will be used at that
level -- whether inherited or not -- you can use the <code>derived()</code>
method to get an area with all inherited data applied:</p>
<pre>var derivedData = $.jog('ui').derived();</pre>

<p>Then you can call <code>derivedData.level()</code> to find out the value
after inheritance (which by default would be <code>Info</code>).</p>

<p>Derived objects are for your information only,they cannot be used to modify
or log. Trying to do anything besides reading data will cause an exception.</p>

<h3>Advanced Topic: Copying Handlers</h3>

<p>There are two ways to get different handlers. You can make copies of other
handles and modify their settings, or you can create your own kinds of
handlers.</p>

<p>Copying an existing handler is a way to get a handler of the same kind but
with different configurations. For example, you might want to put messages from
different areas in different HTML tables:</p>
<pre>var otherHtml = $.jog.knownHandlers.html.copy('otherHtml');
otherHtml.config({htmlId: 'otherHtmlArea'});
$.jog().addHandlers($.jog.knownHandlers.html);
$.jog('ui').addhandlers(otherHtml);
$.jog('ui').useParentHandlers(false);</pre>

<p>This would put <code>ui</code> messages into a table under the node with the
id <code>otherHtmlArea</code>, apart from all others. If you did not turn off
using parent handlers, the log messages would appear in both places.</p>

<h3>Advanced Topic: Custom Handlers</h3>

<p>You can also write your own handler types. The <code>newHandler()</code>
function is core to doing it:</p>
<pre>var myHandler = $.jog.newHandler(name, {
    publish: function(area, levelNum, level, when, message) { ... }
});</pre>

<p>The <code>newHandler()</code> method creates a new handler object with the
given name, and then copies the properties of the second parameter to this
object. Each handler has a <code>name</code> field, a <code>config()</code>
method to set properties, stored in a <code>_settings</code> field, that can be
used by the <code>publish()</code> and other methods. (The settings field is
not exposed as part of the API because it is often better for a change of
settings to result in immediate action, rather than have each method checking
to see if the settings have been changed since the last time some method was
invoked on the handler.) The name is required, but need not be unique.</p>

<p>By default, the handler's <code>copy()</code> method uses a deep
<code>$.extend()</code> to make a copy. Your handler may require other things
to be reset; for example, if your code caches a value for its work, a copy
would probably need to start with an empty cache instead of keeping the cached
values. If this is true, your handler class must provide a
<code>copyCleanup()</code> method that will be called before
<code>copy()</code> returns. (If for some reason your handler cannot support
multiple copies, <code>copyCleanup()</code> can throw an exception.)</p>

<p>The <code>publish()</code> method is what is called by <code>log()</code>,
and is required of all handlers. The parameters are those from the
<code>log()</code> call, with <code>when</code> being the string version of the
time, appropriately formatted.</p>

<h3>Reference: The API</h3>

<p>General API notes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Area names are matched exactly -- case matters.</li>
  <li>Levels can be passed as numbers, string versions of numbers, the name of
    the level, or any string whose first letter is the same as the first letter
    of a level (ignoring case). It can even be an object whose
    <code>toString()</code> method returns such a string. But numbers (as from
    <code>$.jog.Fine</code>) is always faster.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Apologia: Why This Logging Package Exists</h3>

<p>There are several existing log packages for JQuery, so why does this one
need to exist? None of the others had the ability to do two important things
for real-world, durable, usable logging: areas and handlers.</p>

<p>Areas let you split logging for one area of the code from another and
control them independently This is critical for plugins or other shared code.
Without areas, if someone using it wants to log their own stuff, they also see
your log messages when they turn logging on. This gets much worse if they are
using multiple plugins. So you need to strip your log statements as part of
releasing your code, which defeats the purpose. Jog has areas so you can leave
your log messages in place and they won't bother anyone else -- unless you ask
them to turn it on to help debug a problem.</p>

<p>Handlers are important because plugins and applications and programmers
differ. Console log messages can be ugly and difficult to save, but are simple
and don't interfere with your own page. HTML logs do interfere, but CSS can
make it easier to see what's up, and you can search and save. Logs in a popup
don't interfere and can handle multiple browser windows in one place, although
having another window can be a hassle. And alerts, well, you know how
unpleasant they are -- and how necessary at times.</p>

<p>As you can see, depending on how you like to work (and others on the same
project), and many other factors, being able to control how message are
displayed is a powerful thing. And you can add a logger to send messages to
your server, or one that uses Growl, or ...</p>

<p>So that is why I found it worth the time to write this. I hope it helps you
out.</p>
