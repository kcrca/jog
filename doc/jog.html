<h2>JOG: Javascript Logging Package</h2>

<h3>Quick Start</h3>

<p>Jog is a logging package for Javascript and JQuery, designed to be used for
client-side application logging, analogous to Java packages such as log4j or
java.util.logging. It allows you to separate your logs into various areas so
you can turn on the logs of one area without seeing all the others, especially
those of plugins or other packages you may be using. Using jog usually is as
simple as this:</p>
<pre>$.jog('options').info('Reading user option settings');</pre>

<p>This creates an informational-level log message for the "options" area of
your code to indicate you were, well, reading the user option settings.</p>

<p>"Info" is just one of several levels, ranging from "Fine" (for very
fine-grained debug logging) to "Alert" for messages that should be signaled
even to non-developers. You can configure what level of messages you are
interested in generally, and for specific areas of your code. If you were
currently debugging the options area of your code you could:</p>
<pre>$.jog('options').level($.jog.Debug);</pre>

<p>By default this puts informational-level log messages on the console, but
you can configure messages to go onto the page, or in a popup window, or any
place you like:</p>
<pre>$.jog('options').addHandlers($.jog.baseHandlers.popup);</pre>

<p>This adds a handler for options messages that puts log messages in a popup
window, as well as on the console.</p>

<h3>The Basics: Areas and Levels</h3>

<p>When developing and debugging software you often want to track values or
which code is executing. Sometimes these debug messages are worth holding on to
for the next time you have problems in that same code. Logging is a common way
to do this: Instead of simple print statements, you put in conditional print
statements that can be turned on and off as needed. In Java, the
<code>java.util.logging</code> package and the log4j package provide these
tools. Other languages have similar tools. The jog package is designed to do
this for Javascript/JQuery using terms and approaches that are already familiar
to developers.</p>

<p>Each log messages applies to some area of code, so the basic organizing
block of jog is the <span style="font-style: italic;">area.</span> When you
write a log statement, you start by specifying the area to jog:</p>
<pre>$.jog(<span style="font-style: italic;">areaName</span>)</pre>

<p>The jog function returns an object that manages logging in that area. The
primary operation on that object is to write log messages:</p>
<pre>$.jog(<span style="font-style: italic;">areaName</span>).log(<span style="font-style: italic;">level</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">message</span>)</pre>

<p>Each area has a <span style="font-style: italic;">level</span> at which it
is allowing messages to be displayed. Messages at that level or above are
displayed; messages below it are silently ignored. The levels are
<code>Fine</code>, <code>Debug</code>, <code>Info</code>, <code>Config</code>,
<code>Warning</code>, <code>Severe</code>, <code>Alert</code>, and
<code>Off</code>. The default logging threshold level for all areas if
<code>Info</code>. The level constants are obtained directly from jog. For
example, the constant for debug level messages is <code>$.jog.Debug</code>.</p>

<p>You can also specify the message level by invoking the appropriately-named
method on the area object, such as:</p>
<pre>$.jog('options').info('Reading user option settings');</pre>

<p>Generally this form is easier to read and takes less space, but you might
sometimes need the level-specifying <code>log()</code> function when you are
writing code where the level must come from a variable.</p>

<p>Areas can have sub-areas. This is a good way to isolate your log messages
from other people's code, and to break up your own log messages into logical
groupings. You might, for example, be writing an application that has a UI,
various local computation, and communication with a remote server. If this is a
simple application you might only need three areas.</p>

<p>But if the UI, for example, had a separate user preferences area, you might
want to have "ui.main" and "ui.prefs". Which in fact defines three areas:
"ui.main", "ui.prefs", and their common parent area "ui". You can turn on debug
messages for both by setting them on the parent:</p>
<pre>$.jog('ui').level($.jog.Debug);</pre>

<p>If a threshold level isn't set on an area, it will use it's parent's value.
And at the top there is a root area which is unnamed, and has the overall
defaults. The root area is where the default level of <code>Info</code> is set.
For example, this would set the overall log level to <code>Debug</code>: </p>
<pre>$.jog().level($.jog.Debug);</pre>

<p>The settings used for an area will be the most specific to that area. In
other words, when looking for a threshold level for <code>ui.prefs</code>, the
area ui.prefs is checked for a level setting. If there isn't one, then the
<code>ui</code> area is checked. Finally, the root level is checked if no
intervening area has a setting.</p>

<p>If you want to print out more than a basic log message, you may want to
first check to see if the resulting message would be visible. For example, if
calculating the values to show is expensive, there is no reason to do that if
the log message will just get filtered out. You can do this by omitting a
message:</p>
<pre>if ($.jog('ui').log($.jog.Debug)) {
    // ... calculate median value ...
    $.jog('ui').log($.jog.Debug, 'The median value is ' + median);
}</pre>

<p>You can hold on to area objects so you don't have to keep looking them up.
This further reduces the overhead of using log messages because the lookup is
done only once. If your UI code is split into one file, for example, you could
have this near the top:</p>
<pre>var uiLogger = $.jog('ui');</pre>

<p>Then later on in the code you can use uiLogger instead of looking up the
logger:</p>
<pre>if (uiLogger.log($.jog.Debug)) {
    // ... calculate median value ...
    uiLogger.log($.jog.Debug, 'The median value is ' + median);
}</pre>

<p>If you want an area to stop enforcing a threshold, you can take it away by
using a level of <code>undefined</code>. Then it will once again delegate the
threshold choice to an area above it.</p>
<pre>$.jog('ui.prefs').level(undefined);</pre>

<p>The level named <code>Off</code> is the highest level, intended to be used
only as a threshold level. Therefore it is not a valid level for a log message.
A log at the <code>Off</code> level is never shown.</p>

<p>The object $.jog.levels has the levels -- and only the levels -- as its
properties. The level names are usually accessed through <code>$.jog</code>
itself (<code>$.jog.Fine</code>) instead of this object
(<code>$.jog.levels.Fine</code>) It is a way you can loop through the
levels:</p>
<pre>for (var logLevel in $.jog.levels) { ... }</pre>

<p>It is perfectly possible to log messages in the root area, but you should
only do this if you are writing code you don't expect anyone else to use. If
you did that in a function you published for others, and they wanted to use jog
too, your messages would be displayed along with any of theirs, and that would
be unwelcome. If you expect others to use your code, put logging into an area
whose name you expect to be unique to your code.</p>

<h3>Basic Output: Handlers</h3>

<p>Once a log message has passed the level threshold test, where does it go?
The answer is that you can configure that.</p>

<p><em>Handlers</em> are objects that take messages and presents them. The
default handler shows messages on the consolve via <code>console.log</code>:</p>
<pre>ui - Info - 19:12:12 - The median value is 4.3</pre>

<p>These are the components of the displayed log message: the area, level, the
current time, and message.</p>

<p>The base handler objects that are provided by jog are:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>console</dt>
    <dd>Writes messages to <code>console.log</code>.</dd>
  <dt>html</dt>
    <dd>Writes messages to table on the current page.</dd>
  <dt>popup</dt>
    <dd>Pops up a new window and writes messages to table on that page.</dd>
</dl>

<p>When a log message should be displayed, the area defines which handlers will
be used. In most cases the handlers for an area is the union of all the
handlers in itself and its parents, including the root. (It is possible to mark
an area as not inheriting handlers from its parents, though that is uncommon.)
The handlers are asked (in any order) to do their job.</p>

<p>Again, the root area is the place where the defaults are. In this case, the
set of handlers at the root is what is used by most areas, and its default is
solely the console handler. You can access the basic handlers listed above this
way:</p>
<pre>$.jog.baseHandlers</pre>

<p>For example, if you want to change the root area's default handler to the
html handler, you could do this:</p>
<pre>$.jog().addHandlers($.jog.baseHandlers.html);
$.jog().removeHandlers($.jog.baseHandlers.console);</pre>

<p>Or more simply, you could just replace the list of handlers:</p>
<pre>$.jog().handlers($.jog.baseHandlers.html);</pre>

<p>You can configure these handler objects via their <code>config()</code>
methods, which take property objects. For example, the <code>html</code>
handler can be told the ID of the HTML element inside which the log should be
placed:</p>
<pre>$.jog.baseHandlers.html.config({htmlId: 'putTheLogHere'});</pre>

<p>Here are the base handlers and their configurable values:</p>
<dl>
  <dt><code>console</code></dt>
    <dd>Each log message is printed on the console using
      <code>console.log()</code>. </dd>
    <dd><dl>
        <dt><code>prefix</code></dt>
          <dd>A prefix that will be added to every log message on the console.
            This could help you find jog's log messages amidst other consol log
            message. The default is <code>""</code>. </dd>
        <dt><code>separator</code></dt>
          <dd>The separator between elements in log messages. The default is
            <code>" - "</code>. </dd>
      </dl>
    </dd>
  <dt><code>html</code></dt>
    <dd>Each message is appended to a table on the current page. By default,
      when the first log message passes the level filter and is to be
      displayed, it will look for an HTML node with a give ID, and append the
      table inside it. </dd>
    <dd><dl>
        <dt><code>idPrefix</code></dt>
          <dd>A prefix applied to the identifiers of HTML elements in the
            generated table of log messages. The default is <code>"jog"</code>,
            so the ID of the table itself is <code>jog-table</code> and the
            header row's id is <code>jog-header</code>. </dd>
        <dt><code>classPrefix</code></dt>
          <dd>A prefix applied to the class names of HTML elements in the
            generated table of log messages. The default is <code>"jog"</code>,
            so the ID of the table itself is <code>jog-table</code>, and the
            header row's id is <code>jog-header</code> (yes, the same as the
            ID's). The cells of the columns also have classes:
            <code>jog-area</code> for the area names; <code>jog-level</code>
            for the levels; <code>jog-when</code> for the times; and
            <code>jog-message</code> for the actual messages. In addition, each
            row has two classes:
            <code>jog-level-</code><em>levelName<code></code></em> and
            <code>jog-area-</code><em>areaName</em> for the level and area of
            the individual log. For example, in an Info message in the ui area,
            they would be <code>log-level-Info</code> and
            <code>log-area-ui</code>. </dd>
        <dt><code>htmlId</code></dt>
          <dd>The ID of the node which will contain the log table, which will
            be created if it doesn't exist. When the first message is to be
            displayed, the handler will first look for a node with that ID. If
            it finds one, the table will be appended to that node. If it does
            not, it will create a blank <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> with this ID.
            This will be appended to the end of the page (but see
            <code>insertHtml</code> below). The default value is generated
            using <code>idPrefix</code>, so the default if
            <code>idPrefix</code> is untouched is <code>jog-html</code>. </dd>
        <dt><code>insertHtml</code></dt>
          <dd>The first time a log message needs to be displayed, if a node
            with the correct ID (htmlId) cannot be found on the page, this
            function will be called to insert it, in the context of the handler
            (so this will be a reference to the handler). The default is to
            append a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> to the body of the page. The
            function must return the node to use; the handler will set the ID
            and class as required. </dd>
      </dl>
    </dd>
  <dt><code>popup</code></dt>
    <dd>A new browser window will be popped up, and inside that window,
      messages will be shown in a table in that window using an html handler
      (with a default configuration). </dd>
    <dd><dl>
        <dt><code>title</code></dt>
          <dd>The title of the window. The default is <code>"Log
            Messages"</code>. </dd>
        <dt><code>css</code></dt>
          <dd>The CSS to use for the page in the window. It can a path name of
            a css file, in which case it will be used in a
            <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> block in the window's header. Or it can
            be a chunk of HTML itself, in which case it will replace that
            <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> node in the header. The default is
            <code>"jog.css"</code>, which is provided as a file with this
            package. </dd>
      </dl>
    </dd>
</dl>

<h3>Advanced Topic: Time Formatting</h3>

<p>An area can also define the format of the time value. By default this is
formatted using the <code>Date</code> object's
<code>toLocaleTimeString()</code> method. You can override this by setting the
<code>timeFormat</code> function in the area's object. Like the threshold
level, this will be inherited by sub-areas that don't themselves override it.
And again, like the threshold level, the default behavior is defined at the
root area, and can be overridden there:</p>
<pre>$.jog().timeFormat = function(when) { ... }</pre>

<p>The when parameter is a <code>Date</code> object whose time is to be
formatted.</p>

<h3>Advanced Topic: Alerts</h3>

<p>Some messages are so critical that you want to make sure they are more
forcefully thrust upon the user. This is the purpose of the <code>Alert</code>
log level. This is a second threshold of an area -- the level at which messages
will be displayed as alerts. Any log at this level or above will be logged not
only as a regular log message but also will be given to each active handler to
display as an alert. If the handler supports this feature, it will perform an
appropriate action.</p>
<pre>$.jog('ui').alert('Cannot store user preferences');</pre>

<p>The only base handler that supports alerts is the <code>console</code>
handler, which will display the log message via an <code>alert()</code>.</p>

<p>You can change the alert level for an area like you can the regular
threshold level:</p>
<pre>$.jog('ui').alertLevel($.jog.Severe);</pre>

<p>And you can use the level also to turn them off:</p>
<pre>$.jog('ui').alertLevel($.jog.Off);</pre>

<h3>Advanced Topic: Custom Handlers</h3>

<p>You can write your own handlers. The <code>newHandler()</code> function is
core to doing it:</p>
<pre>var myHandler = $.jog.newHandler(name, {
    publish: function(area, levelNum, level, when, message) { ... }
});</pre>

<p>The <code>newHandler()</code> method creates a new handler object with the
given name, and then copies the properties of the second parameter to this
object. Each handler has a <code>name</code> field, a <code>config()</code>
method to set properties, stored in a <code>_settings</code> field, that can be
used by the <code>publish()</code> and other methods. (The settings field is
not exposed as part of the API because it is often better for a change of
settings to result in immediate action, rather than have each method checking
to see if the settings have been changed since the last time some method was
invoked on the handler.) The name is required, but need not be unique.</p>

<p>The <code>publish()</code> method is what is called by <code>log()</code>,
and is required of all handlers. The parameters are those from the
<code>log()</code> call, with <code>when</code> being the string version of the
time, appropriately formatted.</p>

<p>If you want your handler to also provide alerts, it should also support an
<code>alert()</code> method that takes the same parameters as
<code>publish()</code>. </p>

<p>If what you need is to have a base handler with two different settings</p>
